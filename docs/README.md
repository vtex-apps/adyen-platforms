This app integrates the [Adyen for Platforms](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms) service with your VTEX marketplace.

## Configuration

### Adyen Payment Setup

‚ö†Ô∏è Before you can use the Adyen Platforms app, the [Adyen Payment connector](https://github.com/vtex-apps/connector-adyen) must be installed and configured in you VTEX account.

### Installing the App

1. Install this app in the desired account using the CLI command `vtex install vtex.adyen-platforms`.
2. In your admin sidebar, select `Adyen for Platforms` under the **Marketplace** section.
3. Select the `Settings` tab:
   - Enter your Platform API credentials.
      - Switch from `Company` account to `Merchant` account
      - Under the **Developers** menu, select `API credentials`
      - Select the username that follows this format `ws\_[123456]@MarketPlace.[YourPlatformAccount]`, if there is no username in that format, see **Creating New Web Service User**
      - Use `Generate New API Key` to create a new key for Adyen and store it somewhere safe. This can be regenerated if lost
   - Enter your production Adyen for Platforms API endpoint. For testing, you can enter the test endpoint: `https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services`. This is also found under the **Developers** menu in your Adyen account.
   - Enter the URL sub-merchants will be directed to when they complete their onboarding. This is optional, see the Onboarding section for details on this process.

### Managing Seller Accounts

The Sellers tab in the Adyen for Platforms menu in your VTEX admin will display all Seller accounts in your VTEX marketplace.
- Users can `Create Adyen Account` for specific sellers
  1. Enter the Adyen Account Holder Code
    - Ensure you're on Adyen's `Merchant` account in Adyen's website
    - Under the `Platform` tab, select `Sub-merchants`. Select the desired `Adyen Account Holder Code`
  2. Enter the Country, Entity Type, Business Name, and Business Email
  3. Set the desired payout schedule. See section `Payout Schedule` for more information
- Users can create a new `Onboarding Link`

#### Onboarding New Sellers

If a seller has not yet been onboarded, you will have the option to create an Adyen account for the selected seller. This option creates a unique URL for that seller. The URL needs to be provided to the seller, which will direct them to the Adyen [hosted onboarding page](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms/hosted-onboarding-page).

You will be able to accept payment on behalf of a seller immediately after created a Adyen account for them, but payouts of collected payments will be disabled until the seller completes the Adyen onboarding process.

‚ÑπÔ∏è After completing the Adyen hosted onboarding, users will be redirecting to the URL you entered in the app settings. If no URL was entered, they are redirected back to a default onboarding success page that is provided when you install the app, `https://[Store]/marketplace/onboard-complete/`

#### Payout Schedule

The Adyen default payout schedule for a seller is `daily`. You can change this setting to the desired interval
